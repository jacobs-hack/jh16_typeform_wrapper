You are getting this email because you have been accepted to jacobsHack! Fall 2016 that is happening on 15th - 16th October at Jacobs University in Bremen, Germany.

If you are travelling from outside Bremen, arriving on Friday, and need a place to crash, please fill out our guest matching form: https://jacobshack.typeform.com/to/cf5yLu.

We will try our best to match you with students but since there are only few hosts because it's a small university, we also recommend looking at nearby hostels www.hostelworld.com/Hostels/Bremen.

If you are from Bremen and are willing to host a student, please fill out the student matching form https://jacobshack.typeform.com/to/fSUW5X

Cheers,\n
The jacobsHack! team"""
